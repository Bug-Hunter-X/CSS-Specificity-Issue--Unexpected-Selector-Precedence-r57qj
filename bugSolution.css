The solution involves understanding and correctly applying CSS specificity rules.

One approach to avoid the unexpected behavior is to restructure the CSS.  A better practice is to avoid such complex selectors and to be more explicit about the style you intend to apply to the element. 
Here's how you can modify the CSS for clarity:

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
#container {
  width: 600px;
}

.container {
  width: 500px; /* Or remove this if not needed */
}
```
This revised CSS clearly sets the width of the element with the id `container` to 600px, resolving the unexpected specificity behavior.  It's generally best to avoid overly complex selectors to enhance code readability and maintainability.
