The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
.container {
  width: 500px;
}

#container {
  width: 600px;
}

.container #container {
  width: 700px;
}

<div class="container" id="container"></div>
```

This code is designed to showcase the specificity rules in CSS. The `<div>` element has both the class `container` and the ID `container` .  Normally, the ID selector (`#container`) has higher specificity than the class selector (`.container`).  However, the third rule (`.container #container`) is surprisingly specific because of the combinator.
